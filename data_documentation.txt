Input Features (15 total)
------------------------
1. Original Velocities:
   - x_vel: X-axis velocity
   - y_vel: Y-axis velocity
   - z_vel: Z-axis velocity

2. Moving Averages (strongest predictors):

   - x_vel_ma20: 20-frame moving average of X velocity
   - y_vel_ma5: 5-frame moving average of Y velocity
   - y_vel_ma10: 10-frame moving average of Y velocity
   - y_vel_ma20: 20-frame moving average of Y velocity
   - z_vel_ma5: 5-frame moving average of Z velocity
   - z_vel_ma10: 10-frame moving average of Z velocity

Data Structure
-------------
- Window Size: 200 frames
- Trial Size: 600 frames
- Input Shape: (batch_size, 200, 15)
- Output Shape: (batch_size, 6)

Data Processing
--------------
1. Features are calculated from raw velocities
2. All features are standardized using z-score normalization
3. Data is split into trials of 600 frames
4. Windows of 200 frames are created within each trial
5. Each window predicts the joint angles at its last frame
6. Data is split into train/validation/test sets with random permutation

Model Training
-------------
- Batch sizes: 16, 32, 64, or 128
- Learning rate range: 1e-4 to 1e-2
- Early stopping with patience
- Models save their best state based on validation loss
- Predictions are plotted for visualization after training
